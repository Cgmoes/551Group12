A brief narrative:
- We created SSL certificates for the directory server and 3 chat server topics
- We modified the directory server to require a TLS handshake from chat servers / clients at connection time
- We modified the chat servers to perform a TLS handshake before connecting to the directory server, and to require a TLS handshake from incoming clients
- We modified the chat client to perform a TLS handshake with both directory and chat server, as well as verifying that the sent cerificates are correct and match the common name


HOW TO RUN:
1. Modify inet.h to use the correct IP / port, then compile with: "make".

2. To start the directory server: ./directoryServer5

3. To add a chat server to the directory: ./chatServer5 <name> <port> <.crt file> <.key file>
   "name" must match the prefix of the .crt / .key files for incoming chatClients to verify

   These are the possible chatServer commands using the certificates provided:
   ./chatServer5 Sports <port> Sports.crt Sports.key
   ./chatServer5 Food <port> Food.crt Food.key
   ./chatServer5 Films <port> Films.crt Films.key

5. To start a chatClient: ./chatClient5
